<h2 id=whatis>What is the Helper Threads Toolkit?</h2>

<p>It's a library to help developers build libraries. More specifically, to build
	non-blocking libraries.
</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts:</h2>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>A task is an action that could be time-consuming, therefore it's separated
	in four steps: Preparation, Work, Update(s) and Finishing.
</p>
<p>The first step creates an object (what I call a task object) to identify it
	at the other three steps. The second step, Work, occurs in background; without
	blocking the main Lua execution. The third step, Update, can occur any number
	of times (including zero times), as needed by the Work process. Finally, the
	Finishing step is in fact the only Update done after the Work step finishes, it
	occurs exactly once and the task is disposed.
</p>

<h3>Queue</h3>
<p>These are First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queues holding task objects. A task is added
	at the end of the queue with <code>queue:addtask(task)</code>, and retrieved at the front with
	<code>queue:wait([timeout])</code>.
</p>

<p>There are two types of queues: input queues, where prepared tasks are added;
	and output queues, where tasks are added by the threads to notify its completion or any
	intermediate event.
</p>

<h3>Thread</h3>
<p>A thread is a separate execution context. It's only for C code and it can't touch
	or access the Lua state. This restriction makes the library much simpler, and
	improves performance significatively. Each thread has an input queue and an output
	queue, either one can be shared by several threads. 
</p>

<p>During execution, a thread waits on it's input queue for a task. When it gets one,
	it calls it's work function. After that function returns, marks the task as "Done" and
	puts it in it's output queue. Finally, returns to waiting on the input queue and repeats
	it all over again.
</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>To start a task, it has to get some parameters about the work to be performed. Also,
	it usually have to allocate some memory to hold these parameters and any result.
	All this is done in the "Preparation" step, and ends returning the task object to
	the calling Lua code.
</p>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>This is where all get's done. It's the time-consuming step wich we want to avoid
	blocking the Lua code.
</p>
<p>When a thread picks a task from its input queue, the task's work function is called.
	This function does all the work according to the parameters collected at the "Preparation"
	step.
</p>
<p>Since this function is called in a separate execution context, it can't directly
	interact with the Lua code; but if needed it can signal an event, making the unfinished
	task object to appear in the output queue. This signalling is optional, and can be
	repeated as many times as needed. There's also the option to pause the thread until
	the task is 'Updated'.
</p>

<h3>Update(s)</h3>
<p>When the task object appears in the output queue, the Lua code should do an 'update'
	on the task.  This is an oportunity for the C library to interact with the running Lua
	code.  These updates should be brief, just to copy some data and/or state between the
	two contexts.
</p>
<p>The task's work function initiates these interactions making the task object appear
	in the output queue, optionally blocking itself until the Lua code responds. In this
	case, the thread is resumed as soon as the update is done.
</p>

<h3>Finishing</h3>
<p>This step doesn't have it's own API functions; it's just the last update. When the
	work function finishes, the helper library automatically puts the task object in the
	output queue, with a state of "Done"; and after the Lua code calls the update function,
	the task is considered "Finished" and disposed.
</p>
<p>This is where most libraries will return data from the work just finished to the
	calling Lua code.
</p>

<h2 id="luaapi">The Lua API:</h2>

<p>Note that this API doesn't provide a function to create a task object. These are
	created by C libraries that use the Helper Thread Toolkit. For example, the
	<code>nb_file.read(file, len)</code> function (part of the sample "nb_file" library)
	creates and returns a task object that identifies the read operation and encapsulates
	the given parameters <code>file</code> and <code>len</code>.
</p>
<p>In most cases, these functions would be called by a Lua dispatcher; that is, some
	Lua framework that manages several Lua threads of execution using coroutines or maybe
	some other methods.
</p>

<h3><code>helper.newqueue ()</code></h3>
<p>Returns a newly created queue object.
</p>

<h3><code>helper.newthread (input, output)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a newly created thread object. It's spawned and running, so if the input
	queue has task objects in it, they'll be executed ASAP. Either or both queues can
	be shared with other threads.
</p>
<p> If more than one thread have the same input queue,
	you can't predict wich one will execute a given task. If the input thread is used by
	only one thread, the tasks will be executed sequentially, with no reordering.
</p>
<p>Each task will be added to the output queue, where the Lua code can get them using
	the <code>peek()</code> or <code>wait()</code> methods. If several threads have the
	same output queue, a single <code>wait()</code> line could get events from all those
	threads (a single task for each call, of course).
</p>

<h3><code>helper.update (task [, ...])</code></h3>
<p>When a task appears at an output queue, the Lua code should respond calling this
	function. The task's update handler (in the C library) has access to any extra parameters
	given here, and can return any value(s) to the Lua code.
</p>
<p>If the task is in the "Done" state, this update will be the last one for this task;
	and the task will be marked as "Finished" after this call, and eventually disposed.
</p>
<p>If the task is in the "Ready" state, it means it has been prepared; but it's not in
	any queue, so it hasn't begun execution by any thread. In this case, the task is
	executed immediatly and in a blocking manner. This makes easy for a Lua dispatcher to
	'wrap' the task preparation functions and provide a simple blocking API over the
	non-blocking one provided by the underlying C library.
</p>

<h3><code>helper.state (task)</code></h3>
<p>Returns an string indicating the task's state. The possible results are:
	<ul>
		<li>"<code>NULL</code>" before the task preparation, shouldn't happen.</li>
		<li>"<code>Ready</code>" after preparation, not on a queue.</li>
		<li>"<code>Waiting</code>" the task is in a queue, waiting to be picked
			by a thread.</li>
		<li>"<code>Busy</code>" currently being executed by a thread.</li>
		<li>"<code>Paused</code>" the thread has paused and put it in the output queue.
			Maybe has some data for you, maybe needs some more data.
			Call <code>helper.update (task [, ...])</code> to interact with it and
			unpause the thread.</li>
		<li>"<code>Done</code>", The task's work is done, call
			<code>helper.update (task [, ...])</code> to get any result(s).</li>
		<li>"<code>Finished</code>", It has fulfilled it's purpose in life and will
			be soon disposed.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3><code>queue:addtask (task)</code></h3>
<p>Use this function to add tasks to input queues. The task should be in the "Ready" state,
	or it will be rejected. If the queue is currently empty and has a thread waiting on it,
	the task would be immediatly picked and executed.
</p>

<h3><code>queue:remove (task)</code></h3>
<p>Removes a task from the queue.  If it was in the "Waiting" state, it's returned
	to the "Ready" state. Returns the given task if successful, or nil if not (maybe it
	wasn't in this queue anymore).
</p>

<h3><code>queue:peek ()</code></h3>
<p>Returns the front task of a queue, or nil if the queue was empty. Doesn't block nor
	modify the queue in any way.
</p>

<h3><code>queue:wait ([timeout])</code></h3>
<p>Removes and returns the front task from the queue. If the queue is empty, it waits at
	most <code>timeout</code> seconds before returning nil. If no <code>timeout</code>
	is given, blocks indefinitely until a task appears in the queue.
</p>

<h2 id="capi">The C API</h2>

<p>This API is used by C programmers that use the Helper Threads Toolkit to create
	non-blocking libraries. For each 'task-able' operation, the library writer has
	to provide three C callback functions and register them as the task operations.
</p>

<h3><code>int (*prepare) (lua_State *L, void **udata)</code></h3>
<p>This user-defined function is called in the main thread. It should get any needed
	parameters from the Lua State, and set <code>*udata</code> to a pointer holding
	any userdata associated with the task.
</p>

<h3><code>int (*work) (void *udata)</code></h3>
<p>This callback is the one doing all the work. It gets called by the helper thread
	and shouldn't touch or access in any way the Lua state. The <code>*udata</code>
	provided is the same one set by <code>prepare()</code> for this task, it should
	point to a private structure holding any parameter needed.
</p>
<p>One-shot tasks only need to do any work in this function, probably blocking on I/O,
	and store any results in the userdata structure. When this function finishes, the
	helper threads library will set the task's state to "Done" and put it in the output
	queue, maybe waking up a waiting Lua code.
</p>
<p>Long-running tasks might want to signal events to the Lua code, maybe to return
	some intermediate results or maybe to request some more data to work. Use the
	<code>signal_task()</code> function for that.
</p>

<h3><code>int (*update) (lua_State *L, void *udata)</code></h3>
<p>This callback is executed each time the Lua code calls the <code>helper.update(task)</code>
	function. It's has access both to the Lua state (to get any extra parameter and/or
	return any result) and to the task's userdata.
</p>
<p>After this function returns, the task state will be updated. If the task was in the
	"Paused" state, it'll be reset to the "Busy" state and any waiting thread will be resumed.
	If it was in the "Done" state (because the <code>work()</code> callback has already
	returned), it'll be set to the "Finished" state and disposed soon.
</p>

<pre><h3><code>typedef struct task_ops {
	int (*prepare) (lua_State *L, void **udata);
	int (*work) (void *udata);
	int (*update) (lua_State *L, void *udata);
} task_ops;
</code></h3></pre>

<p>This struct holds the three callbacks for a task. Used in the
	<code>add_helperfunc()</code> function and <code>task_reg</code> structure.</p>

<h3><code>void add_helperfunc (lua_State *L, const task_ops *ops)</code></h3>
<p>Used to create a task type associated with the callbacks in the <code>ops</code>
	parameter. Pushes in the Lua stack the Lua function that creates, prepares and
	returns the task.
</p>

<pre><h3><code>typedef struct task_reg {
	const char *name;
	const task_ops *ops;
} task_reg;
</code></h3></pre>

<p>This struct associates a name with a <code>task_ops</code> structure. Used in the
	<code>tasklib()</code> function.
</p>

<h3><code>void tasklib (lua_State *L, const char *libname, const task_reg *l)</code></h3>
<p>Analogous to the <code>luaL_openlib()</code> function. <code>libname</code> is a C
	string with the name to be given to the library. <code>l</code> points to an array
	of <code>task_reg</code> structures (finished by a <code>{NULL, NULL}</code>
	record) specifying the names and callbacks of any 'task-able' operations. At return,
	the library's table is left on the Lua stack.
</p>

<h3><code>void signal_task (int pause)</code></h3>
<p>This utility function can be called by the <code>work</code> callback to signal the Lua
	code. The current task will appear in the output queue, where it would eventually be
	picked by the <code>queue:wait()</code> function.
</p>
<p>If <code>pause</code> is non-zero, the task is put in the "Paused" state and the thread
	blocks, waiting for the Lua code to call the <code>helper.update(task)</code> function.
	This is useful if the operation can't continue without some interaction with the Lua
	code.
